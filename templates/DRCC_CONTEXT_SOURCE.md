## 🚀 **Article V: Dynamic Runtime Context Compression (DRCC)**

### **Purpose**
Preserve full constitutional meaning while shrinking runtime context so additional evidence fits without losing fidelity.

### **Scope**
Runtime use of Layers 0–7 plus Layer 5.5; every transformation must remain lossless and auditable through Appendix E.

---

## 📋 **Layer Summary**

### **Layer 0 – Usage Instruction Extraction**
- Split usage guidance from core content
- Log original line ranges in Appendix E

### **Layer 1 – Thai Content Review**
- Remove or relocate redundant Thai-only text while keeping key Thai terms

### **Layer 2 – Diagram Handling**
- Replace diagrams with concise captions + Appendix A references
- Store diagram IDs

### **Layer 3 – Template Codes (`T#`)**
- Map recurring structures to template codes
- Record `T# = full text`

### **Layer 4 – Phrase Codes (`€`)**
- Substitute frequent precise phrases
- Log `€code = phrase`

### **Layer 5 – Word Codes (`$`, `฿`)**
- Replace recurring terms
- Guard against prefix collisions
- Note tier levels

### **Layer 5.5 – Token Join**
- Remove spaces between consecutive dictionary codes
- Validate token counts and log stats
- **Critical Innovation**: Enables pattern-based AI processing by creating compressed tokens without spaces

### **Layer 6 – Markdown Optimization**
- Normalize headings, lists, tables, and code fences without altering semantics

### **Layer 7 – Whitespace & Emoji Optimization**
- Collapse redundant spacing
- Remove non-semantic emoji
- Log counts removed

### **Reverse Expansion**
Restore original text by reversing 7 → 0 using Appendix E mappings.

## 🔧 **Runtime Workflow**

1. **Load the latest dictionaries and mapping log (Appendix E)**
2. **Detect which layers apply to the current context chunk**
3. **Apply Layers 0–7 sequentially when context budget tightens or patterns repeat**
4. **After each cycle, update Appendix E with mappings, metrics, and timestamps**
5. **Run the DRCC checklist before delivering outputs**
6. **When raw text is requested, expand in reverse order and document the restoration**

---

## 🛡️ **Safety & Reversibility Controls**

- **Zero-loss mandate**: Zero-hallucination and security passages must stay human-readable
- **Every transformation requires a mapping entry and timestamp in Appendix E**
- **Resolve code collisions immediately and log regenerated codes**
- **Token join validation must confirm identical token sequences before/after**
- **Maintain hashes or checksums for compressed vs expanded artifacts when feasible**

---

## ✅ **Operational Checklist**

- [ ] Dictionaries/mapping loaded from Appendix E
- [ ] Layers applied in order without skipping
- [ ] New codes or edits recorded in Appendix E
- [ ] Token join validation = PASS
- [ ] Critical passages remain legible in compressed form
- [ ] Expansion rehearsal matches the original text
- [ ] Timestamp + operator note captured in Appendix E

---

## 📝 **Minimal Example**

**Before:**
```
Principle I: Zero Hallucination Policy ensures all claims reference verifiable sources.
```

**After Layers 3/4/5:**
```
T5 €k ensures all claims reference verifiable sources.
```

**After Layer 5.5:**
```
T5€k ensures …
```

**Mapping (Appendix E):**
```
T5 = Principle I: Zero Hallucination Policy
€k = zero hallucination policy
```

**Expand by substituting the codes back and log the successful validation.**

## 🔗 **Integration With Constitutional Framework**

### **TRAAC**
- Evaluate complexity before/after compression to manage reasoning depth

### **RoT**
- Govern template/phrase/word lifecycles, expiration, and validation

### **TUMIX**
- Ensure every agent can read compressed evidence while honoring user authority

### **Constitutional Principles I–XI**
- Remain primary; DRCC optimizes representation only

### **External Sharing**
- When sharing compressed context externally, supply Appendix E so partners can restore the full text

## 🛠️ **Implementation Examples**

### **Template Usage**
```text
User: "How to implement JWT authentication in Python?"

❌ RoT Violation: [Uses outdated template from Python 3.8 without verification]
✅ Constitutional Response: "Found authentication template from 6 months ago. Let me verify current best practices for Python 3.12 and cross-check with official docs before adapting the template."
```

### **Performance Comparison**
```
Traditional AI Processing:
Input: "The constitutional basis requires zero hallucination policy and ensures all claims reference verifiable sources through systematic analysis..."
Process: 47 tokens × sequential analysis
Result: High cognitive load, limited working memory

DRCC-Enhanced Processing:
Input: "T1 €h requires $X$i sources through €l and $Aj$J."
Process: 4 patterns × instant recognition
Result: Lower cognitive load, expanded working memory

AI Cognitive Enhancement Process:
- Pattern Recognition: AI recognizes compressed patterns instead of individual tokens
- Mental Math System: AI performs calculations with compressed representations
- Runtime Optimization: Real-time context adaptation and optimization
```

## 🔬 **DRCC Technical Architecture**

### **7-Layer Advanced Pipeline**
```
Layer 0  : Usage Instruction Extraction (log original ranges)
Layer 1  : Thai Content Review (preserve key terms)
Layer 2  : Diagram Handling (caption + reference)
Layer 3  : Template Compression (T# codes)
Layer 4  : Phrase Compression (€ codes)
Layer 5  : Word Compression ($/฿ codes)
Layer 5.5: Token Join Optimization (critical innovation)
Layer 6  : Markdown Normalization
Layer 7  : Whitespace & Emoji Cleanup
Reverse  : Expand 7 → 0 using Appendix E mappings
```

### **Design Goals**
- Maximize context utilization (≈40% token reduction)
- Keep zero-loss reversibility (Appendix E audit log)
- Integrate with TRAAC / RoT / TUMIX frameworks
- Ensure deterministic expansion to original text

### **Layer Pipeline Workflow**
- Load dictionaries → detect applicable layers → run sequentially
- Log mappings & timestamps → run checklist → expand on demand
- Safety: zero-hallucination text stays readable
- Collision handling: logged and regenerated immediately
- Token join validation: must pass before completion

## 📚 **Appendix E: DRCC Mapping & Audit Log**

### **Required Components**
- **Active template/phrase/word dictionaries** with edition stamps
- **Token join validation outcomes** and rollback references
- **Compression session timestamps** with operator notes
- **Mapping archival** and expiration policy reminder

### **Audit Trail Requirements**
Every transformation must log:
- Timestamp of operation
- Original and compressed forms
- Layer(s) applied
- Validation results
- Operator identification

### **Appendix E Template**
```
Timestamp        : <ISO8601>
Platform         : <platform>
Compression Run  : <id>

Template Codes
  T1 = ...
  T2 = ...

Phrase Codes
  €a = ...
  €b = ...

Word Codes
  $A = ...
  ฿a = ...

Token Join Stats
  pairs_joined = <int>
  chars_saved  = <int>
  tokens_match = PASS / FAIL

Notes
  - Record validation status / collisions / regenerations.
  - Keep historical entries as needed.
```
